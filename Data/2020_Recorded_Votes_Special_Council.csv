Whereas the City of Burlington has no objection to the incremental business opportunities being explored by the government of Ontario announced on December 12, 2019 including the move to an open market for retail cannabis sales; and
Whereas on February 10th, 2020, the government of Ontario announced they were launching consultations to provide consumers more choice and convenience on cannabis while giving the private sector enhanced ability to compete against and combat the criminal market; and
Whereas the government of Ontario is asking Ontarians to share their feedback before March 10th, 2020 as they explore certain expanded cannabis-related business opportunities to help inform possible next steps; and
Whereas the online consultation asks the public, businesses, health and other stakeholders to comment on potential new cannabis opportunities, including consumption venues such as cannabis lounges where people could buy and consume cannabis and special occasion permits to allow purchase and use at events such as outdoor festivals and concerts; and
Whereas smoking and vaping of any substances, including cannabis, in Burlington are prohibited in indoor public places and other designated areas under the Smoke-Free Ontario Act of 2017; and
Whereas the City of Burlington conducted a public survey between February 14th and February 23rd seeking input on the future of cannabis sale and use in consumption venues such as cannabis lounges and at public events such as outdoor festivals and concerts and found that, of 969 respondents:

50% were in favour of allowing the sale and consumption of cannabis in places like cannabis lounges and cafés (5% undecided, 45% not in favour)
57% were not in favour of allowing the sale and consumption of cannabis at festivals and events such as music or food festivals, etc. (3% undecided, 40% in favour)
67% felt that municipalities should be able to decide/govern the sale and consumption of cannabis in cafés and lounges (11% undecided, 23% not in favour)
72% felt that municipalities should be able to decide/govern the sale and consumption of cannabis at special events (7% undecided, 21% not in favour); and

449,Special Meeting of Council,12/10/2020,Marianne Meed Ward,"Whereas, in May 2020 City Council endorsed the Terms of Reference for the Burlington Economic Recovery Network (BERN). The Burlington Economic Recovery Network has strategically brought together key stakeholders and business leaders from across Burlington to develop a robust local strategy that will prepare our economy for recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. On December 3rd, the Burlington Economic Recovery Network (BERN) members met to discuss the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on the Burlington business community, current economic realities and ongoing support needed by Burlington business; and
Whereas, we continue to support the Provinces COVID-19 re-opening framework, it is critical to recognize that some of the public health measures have created an uneven playing field in affected jurisdictions, placing small businesses and local retailers at a significant competitive disadvantage when lock-down or red control level occurs. Specifically, larger retail outlets, which are permitted to remain open and sell more than just essentials are in direct competition with small retailers, which are limited to online sales and curb side pick-up or delivery; and
Whereas, we must do everything possible to protect our economy, while at the same time balancing the interests of public health and safety. The survival of small businesses is essential to the Provinces recovery efforts, and as such, we must address the current inequity between small businesses required to limit their sales to online or curbside pickup and those businesses permitted to remain open and continue in-person sales; to avoid unfair competitive advantage between businesses; and to provide consistency with continued effective health risk management in consultation with Public Health; and
Whereas, as we move through the pandemic, the City of Burlington will continue to seek opportunities to work with the province to help Burlington residents and businesses to innovate and provide localized solutions. Recognizing that public health measures and restrictions on business are not one size fits all and need to be varied based on local public health conditions, demographics and geographic scale. The provincial government has been responsive in rolling out and adapting public health on a provincial scale and as we move into the second year of managing our pandemic response we need to acknowledge that what is appropriate in the provinces largest cities may not be appropriate in smaller municipalities that are facing different issues in managing public health while balancing supporting local businesses and economic growth.
Therefore be it resolved that the provincial government be requested to revise the Rules for Areas in Stage 1 under Ontario Regulation 82/20 (the lockdown) to address the inequity created between small businesses required to close and businesses permitted to open and continue sales; to avoid unfair competitive advantage between businesses; and to provide consistency with continued effective health risk management in consultation with Public Health; and
That the provincial government be requested to revise the physical distancing with capacity limits determined on a per square metre basis for persons admitted to all businesses, including restaurants, which are currently in Halton Region under the red control level of the COVID-19 response framework subject to a hard-capped occupancy limit of 10 regardless of business size or capacity based on the current provincial re-opening framework subject to consultation on Public Health best practices; and
That the City of Burlington calls on the province to partner with municipalities to pilot unique/additional parameters and programs with our local business community that may be key to offering a safe consumer and employee experience so that businesses can remain open and viable while recognizing the unique makeup of local communities; and
That a copy of this Resolution be forwarded to the Premier of Ontario, Doug Ford, the Honorable Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction, the Honorable Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, MPPs Jane McKenna, Effie Triantafilopoulos and Parm Gill, Halton Regional Council, AMO, Ontario Big City Mayors (OBCM), Burlington Economic Recovery Network (BERN) and Team Burlington.",,CARRIED

464,Special Meeting of Council,12/10/2020,Paul Sharman,"Whereas, in May 2020 City Council endorsed the Terms of Reference for the Burlington Economic Recovery Network (BERN). The Burlington Economic Recovery Network has strategically brought together key stakeholders and business leaders from across Burlington to develop a robust local strategy that will prepare our economy for recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. On December 3rd, the Burlington Economic Recovery Network (BERN) members met to discuss the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on the Burlington business community, current economic realities and ongoing support needed by Burlington business; and
Whereas, we continue to support the Provinces COVID-19 re-opening framework, it is critical to recognize that some of the public health measures have created an uneven playing field in affected jurisdictions, placing small businesses and local retailers at a significant competitive disadvantage when lock-down or red control level occurs. Specifically, larger retail outlets, which are permitted to remain open and sell more than just essentials are in direct competition with small retailers, which are limited to online sales and curb side pick-up or delivery; and
Whereas, we must do everything possible to protect our economy, while at the same time balancing the interests of public health and safety. The survival of small businesses is essential to the Provinces recovery efforts, and as such, we must address the current inequity between small businesses required to limit their sales to online or curbside pickup and those businesses permitted to remain open and continue in-person sales; to avoid unfair competitive advantage between businesses; and to provide consistency with continued effective health risk management in consultation with Public Health; and
Whereas, as we move through the pandemic, the City of Burlington will continue to seek opportunities to work with the province to help Burlington residents and businesses to innovate and provide localized solutions. Recognizing that public health measures and restrictions on business are not one size fits all and need to be varied based on local public health conditions, demographics and geographic scale. The provincial government has been responsive in rolling out and adapting public health on a provincial scale and as we move into the second year of managing our pandemic response we need to acknowledge that what is appropriate in the provinces largest cities may not be appropriate in smaller municipalities that are facing different issues in managing public health while balancing supporting local businesses and economic growth.
Therefore be it resolved that the provincial government be requested to revise the Rules for Areas in Stage 1 under Ontario Regulation 82/20 (the lockdown) to address the inequity created between small businesses required to close and businesses permitted to open and continue sales; to avoid unfair competitive advantage between businesses; and to provide consistency with continued effective health risk management in consultation with Public Health; and
That the provincial government be requested to revise the physical distancing with capacity limits determined on a per square metre basis for persons admitted to all businesses, including restaurants, which are currently in Halton Region under the red control level of the COVID-19 response framework subject to a hard-capped occupancy limit of 10 regardless of business size or capacity based on the current provincial re-opening framework subject to consultation on Public Health best practices; and
That the City of Burlington calls on the province to partner with municipalities to pilot unique/additional parameters and programs with our local business community that may be key to offering a safe consumer and employee experience so that businesses can remain open and viable while recognizing the unique makeup of local communities; and
That a copy of this Resolution be forwarded to the Premier of Ontario, Doug Ford, the Honorable Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction, the Honorable Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, MPPs Jane McKenna, Effie Triantafilopoulos and Parm Gill, Halton Regional Council, AMO, Ontario Big City Mayors (OBCM), Burlington Economic Recovery Network (BERN) and Team Burlington.",Yes,CARRIED

Whereas on November 28, 2016 Burlington City Council voted to Direct the City Clerk to monitor ranked ballot elections in Ontario and report back to Council with a comprehensive report following the 2018 Municipal Election; and

Whereas on September 28, 2020 the City Clerk in Burlington did provide Burlington City Council with this comprehensive report and Burlington City Council voted to have staff initiate a public consultation process on the use of ranked ballots in future municipal elections; and
Whereas every one of the 444 municipalities in Ontario is unique and should have the ability to choose a voting system that meets their needs and provides residents with a voting system that ensures public confidence, encourages voting and participation in the democratic process, is accessible and inclusive, safe guards the public trust in the election process and will result in a council that can effectively represent constituents interest; and

Whereas every political party in Ontario uses a ranked ballot voting system to elect its leader, including the present provincial leadership; and

Whereas the City of Burlington has approached municipalities throughout Ontario to come together to form a collective alliance to share consulting costs as well as any collaborative procurement opportunities to reduce the financial impact to all, if our residents support a change; and

Whereas Bill 218, Supporting Ontarios Recovery and Municipal Elections Act, 2020, proposes removing the option of using ranked ballots for municipal elections from municipalities, was introduced with no prior consultation with municipalities, and while many municipalities had yet to complete their public consultation on ranked ballots; and

Therefore be it resolved:
That the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing is requested to remove the proposed changes to the Municipal Act from Bill 218 that eliminate the option for municipalities to choose a ranked ballot voting system; and

That the provincial government meaningfully consult with municipalities on municipal issues before introducing legislative changes of this magnitude; and
