322,Regular Meeting of Council,5/25/2020,Marianne Meed Ward,"Whereas, businesses throughout Halton Region are suffering catastrophic losses of revenue during the COVID19 public health emergency as a result of reduced demand for products and services or by being closed by order of the Province of Ontario during the pandemic resulting in losses of countless jobs and the inability of business operators to continue to pay expenses during the emergency including rent for their business premises; and
Whereas, Restaurants Canada, the trade organization for the food service industry, reports that 10% of Canadian restaurants permanently closed by the end of March and as many as 50% of those remaining are at risk of failure, in no small measure, due to the lack of ability to pay rent or secure affordable accommodation from their landlords; and
Whereas, the loss of many small and medium businesses will hurt and delay Canadas full economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic; and
Whereas, Halton Region is encouraged by the cooperation between the Federal and Provincial government to develop the Ontario-Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program; and
Whereas, both the Ontario Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business have called for a moratorium on commercial evictions; and
Whereas, in accordance to provisions contained within section 18(i) of the Commercial Tenancies Act, provides that a commercial landlord may repossess leased premises 15 days after the tenant fails to both (i) pay rent and (ii) remedy the failure in the interim and many businesses are either being evicted or are at risk of imminent eviction causing uncertainty for operators and their employees; and
Whereas, the supports that have been provided to businesses to date and predominately focused on keeping staff employed are not sufficient in most cases to keep expenses paid, especially rent, which is often the most significant single operating expense of a business; and
Whereas, the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) program that was announced by the Federal government on April 24, 2020, has not, to this date, been implemented and that the proposed conditions for participation in the CECRA create unreasonable barriers to participation including: requiring that commercial landlords have mortgages and the proceeds of the funding be sent directly to such mortgage holder and not the landlord; that the landlord must both agree to participate and apply for the CECRA, that the landlord must apply for each commercial unit where they own many, and that only leases with gross rents of under $50,000 per month can qualify; and
Whereas, not all landlords choose to apply and there should be flexibility for tenants to qualify for rent subsidy in the case; 
Therefore be it resolved, that Burlington City Council calls upon the Province of Ontario to freeze commercial evictions within the Province of Ontario for a period up to and including thirty days following the conclusion of the order declaring an emergency under s 7.0.1 (1) the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act; and
That City of Burlington Council calls upon the Federal and Provincial governments to resolve barriers to participate in the Ontario-Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (OCECRA) and launch the program immediately; and
That a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the Premier of Ontario, the Ministers of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Minister of Finance, the Prime Minister of Canada, the Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade and the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister Responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), Halton area Members of Provincial Parliament and Members of Parliament as well as all Halton local municipalities, AMO and FCM, the local Chambers of Commerce and the Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses.",Yes,CARRIED

Whereas, Restaurants Canada, the trade organization for the food service industry, reports that 10% of Canadian restaurants permanently closed by the end of March and as many as 50% of those remaining are at risk of failure, in no small measure, due to the lack of ability to pay rent or secure affordable accommodation from their landlords; and
Whereas, the loss of many small and medium businesses will hurt and delay Canadas full economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic; and
Whereas, Halton Region is encouraged by the cooperation between the Federal and Provincial government to develop the Ontario-Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program; and
Whereas, both the Ontario Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business have called for a moratorium on commercial evictions; and
Whereas, in accordance to provisions contained within section 18(i) of the Commercial Tenancies Act, provides that a commercial landlord may repossess leased premises 15 days after the tenant fails to both (i) pay rent and (ii) remedy the failure in the interim and many businesses are either being evicted or are at risk of imminent eviction causing uncertainty for operators and their employees; and
Whereas, the supports that have been provided to businesses to date and predominately focused on keeping staff employed are not sufficient in most cases to keep expenses paid, especially rent, which is often the most significant single operating expense of a business; and
Whereas, the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) program that was announced by the Federal government on April 24, 2020, has not, to this date, been implemented and that the proposed conditions for participation in the CECRA create unreasonable barriers to participation including: requiring that commercial landlords have mortgages and the proceeds of the funding be sent directly to such mortgage holder and not the landlord; that the landlord must both agree to participate and apply for the CECRA, that the landlord must apply for each commercial unit where they own many, and that only leases with gross rents of under $50,000 per month can qualify; and
Whereas, not all landlords choose to apply and there should be flexibility for tenants to qualify for rent subsidy in the case; 
Therefore be it resolved, that Burlington City Council calls upon the Province of Ontario to freeze commercial evictions within the Province of Ontario for a period up to and including thirty days following the conclusion of the order declaring an emergency under s 7.0.1 (1) the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act; and

Whereas, Restaurants Canada, the trade organization for the food service industry, reports that 10% of Canadian restaurants permanently closed by the end of March and as many as 50% of those remaining are at risk of failure, in no small measure, due to the lack of ability to pay rent or secure affordable accommodation from their landlords; and
Whereas, the loss of many small and medium businesses will hurt and delay Canadas full economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic; and
Whereas, Halton Region is encouraged by the cooperation between the Federal and Provincial government to develop the Ontario-Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program; and
Whereas, both the Ontario Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business have called for a moratorium on commercial evictions; and
Whereas, in accordance to provisions contained within section 18(i) of the Commercial Tenancies Act, provides that a commercial landlord may repossess leased premises 15 days after the tenant fails to both (i) pay rent and (ii) remedy the failure in the interim and many businesses are either being evicted or are at risk of imminent eviction causing uncertainty for operators and their employees; and
Whereas, the supports that have been provided to businesses to date and predominately focused on keeping staff employed are not sufficient in most cases to keep expenses paid, especially rent, which is often the most significant single operating expense of a business; and
Whereas, the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) program that was announced by the Federal government on April 24, 2020, has not, to this date, been implemented and that the proposed conditions for participation in the CECRA create unreasonable barriers to participation including: requiring that commercial landlords have mortgages and the proceeds of the funding be sent directly to such mortgage holder and not the landlord; that the landlord must both agree to participate and apply for the CECRA, that the landlord must apply for each commercial unit where they own many, and that only leases with gross rents of under $50,000 per month can qualify; and
Whereas, not all landlords choose to apply and there should be flexibility for tenants to qualify for rent subsidy in the case; 
Therefore be it resolved, that Burlington City Council calls upon the Province of Ontario to freeze commercial evictions within the Province of Ontario for a period up to and including thirty days following the conclusion of the order declaring an emergency under s 7.0.1 (1) the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act; and

Whereas, the Canadian Urban Transit Association (CUTA) Canadas largest public transport lobby, the membership of which includes most Canadian transit agencies including Oakville Transit, has called for urgent emergency funding to address the immediate liquidity issues of transit operators while providing financial stability while ridership rebuilds; and
Whereas, CUTA estimates as many as 40 per cent of systems may require bridge funding over the coming months requiring some $1.2 billion to help them keep the buses and trains running; and
Whereas, CUTA is seeking $400 million a month to keep services running as fare box and other revenue drop by up to 100 per cent; and
Whereas, CUTA notes that it will likely take some time for transit operators to rebuild ridership to February 2020 levels during a gradually return to more normal economic activity; and
Whereas, Burlington Transit was experiencing a 14.2% increase in ridership from September 2019 to February 2020, due to the introduction of new service, schedules and a grid network, prior to the impact COVID-19 pandemic; and
Whereas, Burlington Transit is losing an average of $475 000 in farebox revenue every month as a direct result of the pandemic; and
Whereas, without a quick infusion of funds by the Government of Canada it is impossible to assure that the gains made over the past decade in growing the modal share of all rides taken via collective transit will not be lost;

Whereas, the report has identified that the existing tax tools available to municipalities do not provide targeted relief to specific areas/types of properties to assist in mitigating localized tax impact resulting from significant reassessment valuations;
Therefore, be it resolved that, Burlington City Council endorses the policy resolution submitted to the Ontario Chamber of Commerce which urges the Government of Ontario to;

447,Regular Meeting of Council,5/25/2020,Shawna Stolte,"Whereas, businesses throughout Halton Region are suffering catastrophic losses of revenue during the COVID19 public health emergency as a result of reduced demand for products and services or by being closed by order of the Province of Ontario during the pandemic resulting in losses of countless jobs and the inability of business operators to continue to pay expenses during the emergency including rent for their business premises; and
Whereas, Restaurants Canada, the trade organization for the food service industry, reports that 10% of Canadian restaurants permanently closed by the end of March and as many as 50% of those remaining are at risk of failure, in no small measure, due to the lack of ability to pay rent or secure affordable accommodation from their landlords; and
Whereas, the loss of many small and medium businesses will hurt and delay Canadas full economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic; and
Whereas, Halton Region is encouraged by the cooperation between the Federal and Provincial government to develop the Ontario-Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program; and
Whereas, both the Ontario Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business have called for a moratorium on commercial evictions; and
Whereas, in accordance to provisions contained within section 18(i) of the Commercial Tenancies Act, provides that a commercial landlord may repossess leased premises 15 days after the tenant fails to both (i) pay rent and (ii) remedy the failure in the interim and many businesses are either being evicted or are at risk of imminent eviction causing uncertainty for operators and their employees; and
Whereas, the supports that have been provided to businesses to date and predominately focused on keeping staff employed are not sufficient in most cases to keep expenses paid, especially rent, which is often the most significant single operating expense of a business; and
Whereas, the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) program that was announced by the Federal government on April 24, 2020, has not, to this date, been implemented and that the proposed conditions for participation in the CECRA create unreasonable barriers to participation including: requiring that commercial landlords have mortgages and the proceeds of the funding be sent directly to such mortgage holder and not the landlord; that the landlord must both agree to participate and apply for the CECRA, that the landlord must apply for each commercial unit where they own many, and that only leases with gross rents of under $50,000 per month can qualify; and
Whereas, not all landlords choose to apply and there should be flexibility for tenants to qualify for rent subsidy in the case; 
Therefore be it resolved, that Burlington City Council calls upon the Province of Ontario to freeze commercial evictions within the Province of Ontario for a period up to and including thirty days following the conclusion of the order declaring an emergency under s 7.0.1 (1) the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act; and

Whereas, the project had the full support of Halton Region, its four municipalities and stakeholders across the Province; and
Whereas, the Honourable Geoffrey B. Morawetz Chief Justice of the Superior Court of Justice has acknowledged that the cancellation of the Halton Consolidated Courthouse Project is an access to justice issue and underscores the overall lack of functional courtrooms in the Central West Region; and
Whereas, in a press conference, Regional Senior Justice Peter Daley stated that Miltons courthouse is so dilapidated the province is spending $2.6-million to rid it of mould; and
Whereas, the Toronto Star reported that as a result of the lack of resources and courtrooms at the Milton courthouse, criminal cases that are taking too long to get to trial are being thrown out due to delay; and
Whereas, in a letter to Premier Ford, Halton Police Chief Stephen Tanner wrote the main court facility for Halton Region has been completely inadequate and in fact dangerous, and is beyond repair and beyond renovation; and
Whereas, there are ongoing security issues in the holding areas in the Milton courthouse and with respect to the movement of prisoners throughout the building that pose risks to visitors, staff, and other people in custody; and
Whereas, the Halton Consolidated Courthouse Project was selected as one of five Community Benefits Agreement pilot projects by the Province, these agreements provide workforce development, the purchasing of goods and services from local businesses and supplementary community benefits; and
Whereas, cancelling the project will result in costly fees which will further reduce the governments ability to promote economic stimulus and recovery;
Therefore, be it resolved, that Burlington City Council calls upon the Province of Ontario to postpone rather than cancel the Halton Consolidated Courthouse project, so it will be ready to go as a federal-provincial infrastructure stimulus project as we continue to reopen and reinvigorate our economy; and

Whereas there is a growing body of evidence on the effectiveness of masks and face coverings to act as a barrier to prevent the spread of COVID-19; and
Whereas the wearing of masks and face coverings may act as an ongoing visual clue and reminder that public health measures, including hand-washing and maintaining a safe physical distance from others, are still required, that the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and that a resurgence of local disease activity remains an ongoing threat; and
Whereas the Province of Ontario has enacted O.

Whereas the City of Burlington wants to be prepared for the eventual Stage 3 reopenings under the provincial Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, and use every tool available to protect residents from a resurgence of COVID-19;
Therefore, be it resolved that Burlington City Council enact a temporary bylaw requiring individuals, organizations or corporations that are responsible for the operation of a facility or business, which have indoor, enclosed spaces open to the public, to ensure no member of the public is permitted unless wearing a mask or face covering in a manner which covers their mouth, nose and chin, subject to the exemptions below, to help limit the spread of COVID-19; and

Whereas there is a growing body of evidence on the effectiveness of masks and face coverings to act as a barrier to prevent the spread of COVID-19; and
Whereas the wearing of masks and face coverings may act as an ongoing visual clue and reminder that public health measures, including hand-washing and maintaining a safe physical distance from others, are still required, that the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and that a resurgence of local disease activity remains an ongoing threat; and
Whereas the Province of Ontario has enacted O.

Whereas there is a growing body of evidence on the effectiveness of masks and face coverings to act as a barrier to prevent the spread of COVID-19; and
Whereas the wearing of masks and face coverings may act as an ongoing visual clue and reminder that public health measures, including hand-washing and maintaining a safe physical distance from others, are still required, that the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and that a resurgence of local disease activity remains an ongoing threat; and

Whereas, Restaurants Canada, the trade organization for the food service industry, reports that 10% of Canadian restaurants permanently closed by the end of March and as many as 50% of those remaining are at risk of failure, in no small measure, due to the lack of ability to pay rent or secure affordable accommodation from their landlords; and
Whereas, the loss of many small and medium businesses will hurt and delay Canadas full economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic; and
Whereas, Halton Region is encouraged by the cooperation between the Federal and Provincial government to develop the Ontario-Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program; and
Whereas, both the Ontario Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business have called for a moratorium on commercial evictions; and
Whereas, in accordance to provisions contained within section 18(i) of the Commercial Tenancies Act, provides that a commercial landlord may repossess leased premises 15 days after the tenant fails to both (i) pay rent and (ii) remedy the failure in the interim and many businesses are either being evicted or are at risk of imminent eviction causing uncertainty for operators and their employees; and
Whereas, the supports that have been provided to businesses to date and predominately focused on keeping staff employed are not sufficient in most cases to keep expenses paid, especially rent, which is often the most significant single operating expense of a business; and
Whereas, the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) program that was announced by the Federal government on April 24, 2020, has not, to this date, been implemented and that the proposed conditions for participation in the CECRA create unreasonable barriers to participation including: requiring that commercial landlords have mortgages and the proceeds of the funding be sent directly to such mortgage holder and not the landlord; that the landlord must both agree to participate and apply for the CECRA, that the landlord must apply for each commercial unit where they own many, and that only leases with gross rents of under $50,000 per month can qualify; and
Whereas, not all landlords choose to apply and there should be flexibility for tenants to qualify for rent subsidy in the case; 
Therefore be it resolved, that Burlington City Council calls upon the Province of Ontario to freeze commercial evictions within the Province of Ontario for a period up to and including thirty days following the conclusion of the order declaring an emergency under s 7.0.1 (1) the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act; and

Whereas, the Halton Consolidated Courthouse Project was selected as one of five Community Benefits Agreement pilot projects by the Province, these agreements provide workforce development, the purchasing of goods and services from local businesses and supplementary community benefits; and
Whereas, cancelling the project will result in costly fees which will further reduce the governments ability to promote economic stimulus and recovery;
Therefore, be it resolved, that Burlington City Council calls upon the Province of Ontario to postpone rather than cancel the Halton Consolidated Courthouse project, so it will be ready to go as a federal-provincial infrastructure stimulus project as we continue to reopen and reinvigorate our economy; and
That the Province of Ontario use the Halton Consolidated Courthouse project to aid economic recovery and further job creation; and

Whereas COVID-19 continues to be present within the City of Burlington and surrounding municipalities, and is a disease that is readily communicable from person to person, even with minimal or no signs of symptoms or illness, and carrying a risk of serious complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, kidney failure, liver failure, neurological complications, and may result in death; and
Whereas there is a growing body of evidence on the effectiveness of masks and face coverings to act as a barrier to prevent the spread of COVID-19; and
Whereas the wearing of masks and face coverings may act as an ongoing visual clue and reminder that public health measures, including hand-washing and maintaining a safe physical distance from others, are still required, that the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and that a resurgence of local disease activity remains an ongoing threat; and
Whereas the Province of Ontario has enacted O. Reg.263/20 (Stage 2 Closures) under Subsection 7.0.2 (4) of Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act to permit certain businesses to reopen for attendance by members of the public subject to conditions, including the advice, recommendations and instructions of public health officials; and

Whereas the City of Burlington wants to be prepared for the eventual Stage 3 reopenings under the provincial Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, and use every tool available to protect residents from a resurgence of COVID-19;
Therefore, be it resolved that Burlington City Council enact a temporary bylaw requiring individuals, organizations or corporations that are responsible for the operation of a facility or business, which have indoor, enclosed spaces open to the public, to ensure no member of the public is permitted unless wearing a mask or face covering in a manner which covers their mouth, nose and chin, subject to the exemptions below, to help limit the spread of COVID-19; and

The person is under three years of age.
The person has an underlying medical condition or developmental disability which inhibits their ability to wear a mask or face covering, or other physical disability whereby the wearing of a mask or face covering would limit their ability to reasonably communicate with others.

The person is unable to place or remove a mask or face covering without assistance.
Employees and agents of the person responsible for the establishment are within an area designated for them and not for public access, or within or behind a physical barrier.

That council request the Government of Canada to enact a mandatory mask policy; and

seeking a sponsor to fund or procure/provide masks that would be supplied free of charge to the public, with the sponsor and/or city logo displayed on the mask, and distributed by the city or through the sponsor;
issuing a request for proposals to local businesses to provide a quote on the cost to supply the city with masks that can be distributed to the public, either by the city or by the business, then billed to the city;

Reg.263/20 (Stage 2 Closures) under Subsection 7.0.2 (4) of Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act to permit certain businesses to reopen for attendance by members of the public subject to conditions, including the advice, recommendations and instructions of public health officials; and
Whereas physical distancing can be difficult to maintain in enclosed, indoor spaces open to the public; and
Whereas the City of Burlington wants to be prepared for the eventual Stage 3 reopenings under the provincial Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, and use every tool available to protect residents from a resurgence of COVID-19;
Therefore, be it resolved that Burlington City Council enact a temporary bylaw requiring individuals, organizations or corporations that are responsible for the operation of a facility or business, which have indoor, enclosed spaces open to the public, to ensure no member of the public is permitted unless wearing a mask or face covering in a manner which covers their mouth, nose and chin, subject to the exemptions below, to help limit the spread of COVID-19; and
That the operator of such facilities or businesses that are open to the public, shall conspicuously post at all entrances to the facility or business clearly visible signage outlining the requirements and exemptions of this bylaw; and
That that members of the public attending facilities or businesses that are open to the public shall wear a mask or face covering in a manner which covers their mouth, nose and chin, subject to the exemptions below, and unless it is reasonably required to temporarily remove the covering to access services provided by the establishment, or while actively engaging in an athletic or fitness acuity during physical activity, and exemptions may be accommodated if:


The person is under three years of age.
The person has an underlying medical condition or developmental disability which inhibits their ability to wear a mask or face covering, or other physical disability whereby the wearing of a mask or face covering would limit their ability to reasonably communicate with others.
Wearing a face covering would inhibit the persons ability to breathe in any way.
The person is unable to place or remove a mask or face covering without assistance.
Employees and agents of the person responsible for the establishment are within an area designated for them and not for public access, or within or behind a physical barrier.
Staff identify any other such exemptions that may be advisable, including emotional well-being, mental health, summer camps and registered activities; and


That employees working with members of the public in an enclosed, indoor space must also wear a mask or face covering, unless they are in an area not for public access, or they meet one of the exemptions; and
That employees or members of the public shall not be required to provide proof of any of the exemptions set out herein; and
That the bylaw apply to all City of Burlington indoor facilities open to the public such as community centres, city hall, libraries, art gallery, performing arts centre, and public transit; and
That the bylaw be in force for a temporary period of time, beginning July 20 and expiring September 30, 2020, unless extended or revoked by City Council; and 
That the Executive Director of Legal Services & Corporation Counsel be directed to prepare the necessary bylaw for consideration by City Council on July 13, 2020; and
That the Director of Corporate Communications & Government Relations be directed to develop a communications campaign during the first month the bylaw comes into force and effect to assist residents and businesses to understand the bylaw and exemptions, assist with voluntary compliance, and where people can acquire masks; and
That council request that the Region of Halton present a mandatory mask bylaw for consideration by Regional Council at its meeting of July 15, 2020 to ensure consistency across the region; and
That council request the Province of Ontario to enact a mandatory mask order under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act for those regions that have entered Stage 2 reopening, and/or will enter Stage 3 reopening; and
That council request the Government of Canada to enact a mandatory mask policy; and
That this report be circulated to the Region of Halton, Towns of Halton Hills, Oakville and Milton, all Halton Members of Provincial Parliament, Members of Parliament, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, and the Association of Municipalities of Ontario.
2. Direct the Chief Financial Officer to establish an initial grant of $10,000 to provide non-medical masks free of charge for community members funded from the citys COVID-19 account, and direct the City Managers Office to report back to the August 13, 2020 Corporate Services, Strategy, Risk and Accountability Committee on a plan for providing masks to in-need community members including the consideration of such additional options as: 

seeking a sponsor to fund or procure/provide masks that would be supplied free of charge to the public, with the sponsor and/or city logo displayed on the mask, and distributed by the city or through the sponsor;
issuing a request for proposals to local businesses to provide a quote on the cost to supply the city with masks that can be distributed to the public, either by the city or by the business, then billed to the city;
purchasing masks that can be distributed to members of the public, on a request basis, or made available at the entry to city facilities, once opened;
providing grant funding to residents to purchase their own mask, subject to quantity and cost limitations, and an application process;
other options as they may arise.

3. Direct the City Manager to report back to the August 13, 2020 Corporate Services, Strategy, Risk and Accountability Committee on potential grant funding for businesses and commercial establishments to assist with the cost of signage and masks as mandated by this bylaw, retroactive to the effective in-force date of the bylaw, subject to appropriate criteria.

Whereas new legislation introduces changes and new sections that could remove and/or significantly hinder conservation authorities participation in and support of local planning appeal processes and their ability to protect development from natural hazards; and
Whereas the changes allow the Minister to make decisions without consideration of local conditions, the Conservation Authority Board approved policies, watershed data and technical expertise; and
Whereas the Legislation suggests that the Minister will have the ability to establish standards and requirements for non-mandatory programs which are negotiated between the conservation authorities and municipalities to meet local watershed needs; and
Whereas municipalities require a longer transition time to put in place agreements with conservation authorities for non-mandatory programs; and
Whereas municipalities believe that the appointment of municipal representatives on conservation authority boards should be a municipal decision; and the Chair and Vice Chair of the conservation authority boards should be duly elected; and
Whereas the changes to the Duty of Members contradicts the fiduciary duty of a conservation authority board member to represent the best interests of the conservation authority and its responsibility to the watershed; and
Whereas conservation authorities have already aligned approaches through Memorandums of Understanding with local watershed municipalities to reduce delays, avoid duplication and improve service delivery for all clients; and
Whereas changes to the legislation will create more red tape and costs for the conservation authorities, their municipal partners, and cause delays in the development approval process; and
Whereas municipalities value and rely on the natural habitats and water resources within conservation authority jurisdictions for the health and well-being of residents; municipalities value conservation authorities work to prevent and manage the impacts of flooding and other natural hazards; and municipalities value conservation authorities work to ensure safe drinking water;

Whereas we rely on the watershed expertise provided by local conservation authorities to protect residents, property, and local natural resources on a watershed basis by regulating development under the Conservation Authorities Act, ensuring compliance with the Regulations and engaging in reviews of applications submitted under the Planning Act; and
Whereas new legislation introduces changes and new sections that could remove and/or significantly hinder conservation authorities participation in and support of local planning appeal processes and their ability to protect development from natural hazards; and
Whereas the changes allow the Minister to make decisions without consideration of local conditions, the Conservation Authority Board approved policies, watershed data and technical expertise; and
Whereas the Legislation suggests that the Minister will have the ability to establish standards and requirements for non-mandatory programs which are negotiated between the conservation authorities and municipalities to meet local watershed needs; and
Whereas municipalities require a longer transition time to put in place agreements with conservation authorities for non-mandatory programs; and
Whereas municipalities believe that the appointment of municipal representatives on conservation authority boards should be a municipal decision; and the Chair and Vice Chair of the conservation authority boards should be duly elected; and
Whereas the changes to the Duty of Members contradicts the fiduciary duty of a conservation authority board member to represent the best interests of the conservation authority and its responsibility to the watershed; and
Whereas conservation authorities have already aligned approaches through Memorandums of Understanding with local watershed municipalities to reduce delays, avoid duplication and improve service delivery for all clients; and
Whereas changes to the legislation will create more red tape and costs for the conservation authorities, their municipal partners, and cause delays in the development approval process; and
Whereas municipalities value and rely on the natural habitats and water resources within conservation authority jurisdictions for the health and well-being of residents; municipalities value conservation authorities work to prevent and manage the impacts of flooding and other natural hazards; and municipalities value conservation authorities work to ensure safe drinking water;
Therefore be it resolved;
That the Province of Ontario work with conservation authorities to address their concerns by repealing and/or amending changes to the Conservation Authorities Act and the Planning Act set out in Bill 229; and

That the Province of Ontario delay enactment of clauses affecting municipal concerns; and

That the Province of Ontario provide a longer transition period up to December 2022 for non-mandatory programs to enable coordination of conservation authority municipal budget processes; and

That the Province respect the current conservation authority/municipal relationships; and

That the Province embrace their long-standing partnership with the conservation authorities and provide them with the tools and financial resources they need to effectively implement their watershed management role; and

Whereas we rely on the watershed expertise provided by local conservation authorities to protect residents, property, and local natural resources on a watershed basis by regulating development under the Conservation Authorities Act, ensuring compliance with the Regulations and engaging in reviews of applications submitted under the Planning Act; and
Whereas new legislation introduces changes and new sections that could remove and/or significantly hinder conservation authorities participation in and support of local planning appeal processes and their ability to protect development from natural hazards; and
Whereas the changes allow the Minister to make decisions without consideration of local conditions, the Conservation Authority Board approved policies, watershed data and technical expertise; and
Whereas the Legislation suggests that the Minister will have the ability to establish standards and requirements for non-mandatory programs which are negotiated between the conservation authorities and municipalities to meet local watershed needs; and
Whereas municipalities require a longer transition time to put in place agreements with conservation authorities for non-mandatory programs; and
Whereas municipalities believe that the appointment of municipal representatives on conservation authority boards should be a municipal decision; and the Chair and Vice Chair of the conservation authority boards should be duly elected; and
Whereas the changes to the Duty of Members contradicts the fiduciary duty of a conservation authority board member to represent the best interests of the conservation authority and its responsibility to the watershed; and
Whereas conservation authorities have already aligned approaches through Memorandums of Understanding with local watershed municipalities to reduce delays, avoid duplication and improve service delivery for all clients; and
Whereas changes to the legislation will create more red tape and costs for the conservation authorities, their municipal partners, and cause delays in the development approval process; and
Whereas municipalities value and rely on the natural habitats and water resources within conservation authority jurisdictions for the health and well-being of residents; municipalities value conservation authorities work to prevent and manage the impacts of flooding and other natural hazards; and municipalities value conservation authorities work to ensure safe drinking water;
Therefore be it resolved;
That the Province of Ontario work with conservation authorities to address their concerns by repealing and/or amending changes to the Conservation Authorities Act and the Planning Act set out in Bill 229; and

That the Province of Ontario delay enactment of clauses affecting municipal concerns; and

That the Province of Ontario provide a longer transition period up to December 2022 for non-mandatory programs to enable coordination of conservation authority municipal budget processes; and

Whereas greenhouse gas pollution is causing temperatures in Canada to rise at more than double the rate of the rest of the world, causing impacts to municipal operations and affecting residents of the City of Burlington; and
Whereas the City of Burlington has declared a climate emergency and is taking measures to mitigate and adapt to the climate impacts caused by increasing greenhouse gas pollution; and
Whereas there are feasible, cost-effective alternatives to increasing gas-fired electricity generation without increasing greenhouse gas pollution at costs well below the current price for Ontarios nuclear energy (9.5 cents/kWh), including:

 energy efficiency investments;
 low-cost, distributed, renewable energy, providing employment in Ontario communities and restoring our leadership in this industry; 
 the purchase of low-cost power offered by the Province of Quebec from its existing hydroelectric generating stations; and

Whereas we rely on the watershed expertise provided by local conservation authorities to protect residents, property, and local natural resources on a watershed basis by regulating development under the Conservation Authorities Act, ensuring compliance with the Regulations and engaging in reviews of applications submitted under the Planning Act; and
Whereas new legislation introduces changes and new sections that could remove and/or significantly hinder conservation authorities participation in and support of local planning appeal processes and their ability to protect development from natural hazards; and
Whereas the changes allow the Minister to make decisions without consideration of local conditions, the Conservation Authority Board approved policies, watershed data and technical expertise; and
Whereas the Legislation suggests that the Minister will have the ability to establish standards and requirements for non-mandatory programs which are negotiated between the conservation authorities and municipalities to meet local watershed needs; and
Whereas municipalities require a longer transition time to put in place agreements with conservation authorities for non-mandatory programs; and
Whereas municipalities believe that the appointment of municipal representatives on conservation authority boards should be a municipal decision; and the Chair and Vice Chair of the conservation authority boards should be duly elected; and
Whereas the changes to the Duty of Members contradicts the fiduciary duty of a conservation authority board member to represent the best interests of the conservation authority and its responsibility to the watershed; and
Whereas conservation authorities have already aligned approaches through Memorandums of Understanding with local watershed municipalities to reduce delays, avoid duplication and improve service delivery for all clients; and
Whereas changes to the legislation will create more red tape and costs for the conservation authorities, their municipal partners, and cause delays in the development approval process; and
Whereas municipalities value and rely on the natural habitats and water resources within conservation authority jurisdictions for the health and well-being of residents; municipalities value conservation authorities work to prevent and manage the impacts of flooding and other natural hazards; and municipalities value conservation authorities work to ensure safe drinking water;

That the Province of Ontario delay enactment of clauses affecting municipal concerns; and

Whereas greenhouse gas pollution is causing temperatures in Canada to rise at more than double the rate of the rest of the world, causing impacts to municipal operations and affecting residents of the City of Burlington; and
Whereas the City of Burlington has declared a climate emergency and is taking measures to mitigate and adapt to the climate impacts caused by increasing greenhouse gas pollution; and
Whereas there are feasible, cost-effective alternatives to increasing gas-fired electricity generation without increasing greenhouse gas pollution at costs well below the current price for Ontarios nuclear energy (9.5 cents/kWh), including:

 energy efficiency investments;
 low-cost, distributed, renewable energy, providing employment in Ontario communities and restoring our leadership in this industry; 
 the purchase of low-cost power offered by the Province of Quebec from its existing hydroelectric generating stations; and
 using Quebecs system of reservoirs like a giant battery to back-up made-in-Ontario renewable power, eliminating the need to use gas-fired power plants for this purpose;

Therefore be it resolved that the City of Burlington requests the Government of Ontario to place an interim cap of 2.5 megatonnes per year on greenhouse gas pollution from Ontarios gas-fired power plants and develop and implement a plan to address future energy needs through investing in renewable energy and purchasing low-cost hydro-electric power from the Province of Quebec, making gas-fired electricity generation no longer necessary and supporting its phase-out by 2030 to help Ontario and the City of Burlington meet their climate targets; and
That this resolution be sent to the Premier of Ontario, the Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines, the Minister of the Environment, Conservation and Parks, all local MPPs, the Association of Municipalities of Ontario and copied to the Region of Halton and local municipalities of Oakville, Milton and Halton Hills.",Yes,CARRIED

1285,Regular Meeting of Council,11/23/2020,Angelo Bentivegna,"Whereas the City of Burlington has been well served by both Conservation Halton and Credit Valley Conservation; and
Whereas we rely on the watershed expertise provided by local conservation authorities to protect residents, property, and local natural resources on a watershed basis by regulating development under the Conservation Authorities Act, ensuring compliance with the Regulations and engaging in reviews of applications submitted under the Planning Act; and
Whereas new legislation introduces changes and new sections that could remove and/or significantly hinder conservation authorities participation in and support of local planning appeal processes and their ability to protect development from natural hazards; and
Whereas the changes allow the Minister to make decisions without consideration of local conditions, the Conservation Authority Board approved policies, watershed data and technical expertise; and
Whereas the Legislation suggests that the Minister will have the ability to establish standards and requirements for non-mandatory programs which are negotiated between the conservation authorities and municipalities to meet local watershed needs; and
Whereas municipalities require a longer transition time to put in place agreements with conservation authorities for non-mandatory programs; and
Whereas municipalities believe that the appointment of municipal representatives on conservation authority boards should be a municipal decision; and the Chair and Vice Chair of the conservation authority boards should be duly elected; and
Whereas the changes to the Duty of Members contradicts the fiduciary duty of a conservation authority board member to represent the best interests of the conservation authority and its responsibility to the watershed; and
Whereas conservation authorities have already aligned approaches through Memorandums of Understanding with local watershed municipalities to reduce delays, avoid duplication and improve service delivery for all clients; and
Whereas changes to the legislation will create more red tape and costs for the conservation authorities, their municipal partners, and cause delays in the development approval process; and
Whereas municipalities value and rely on the natural habitats and water resources within conservation authority jurisdictions for the health and well-being of residents; municipalities value conservation authorities work to prevent and manage the impacts of flooding and other natural hazards; and municipalities value conservation authorities work to ensure safe drinking water;
Therefore be it resolved;
That the Province of Ontario work with conservation authorities to address their concerns by repealing and/or amending changes to the Conservation Authorities Act and the Planning Act set out in Bill 229; and

That the Province of Ontario delay enactment of clauses affecting municipal concerns; and

That the Province of Ontario provide a longer transition period up to December 2022 for non-mandatory programs to enable coordination of conservation authority municipal budget processes; and

That the Province respect the current conservation authority/municipal relationships; and

That the Province embrace their long-standing partnership with the conservation authorities and provide them with the tools and financial resources they need to effectively implement their watershed management role; and
