9,Regular Meeting of Council,1/28/2019,Marianne Meed Ward,"Whereas, the Government of Ontario has introduced Bill 66, an Act to restore Ontarios competitiveness by amending or repealing certain Acts; and
 
Whereas, Schedule 10 of the proposed legislation would have amended the Planning Act to allow municipalities to pass open-for-business planning by-laws; and
Whereas, the Bill would have allowed such by-laws to override important planning, water, agricultural and environmental protections contained in the Clean Water Act, 2006, the Greenbelt Act, 2005, the Places to Grow Act, 2005, and other provincial legislation; and
Whereas, no notice or public hearing would have been required prior to the passing of such a by-law nor were there to be any appeal rights thereafter; and
Whereas, the Greenbelt is an integral component of land use planning that complements the Growth Plan to encourage smart planning, the reduction of sprawl, protection of natural and hydrological features and agricultural lands; and
Whereas, Burlingtons land mass is 50% rural, and the Greenbelt protects 1.8 million acres of farmland, local food supplies, the headwaters of our rivers and important forests and wildlife habitat; and
Whereas, a permanent Greenbelt is an important part of the planning for sustainable communities; and
Whereas, Burlington presently has 509 acres (206 hectares) of vacant employment land supply within the urban boundary ready to be used for business, without the need to weaken the protections provided by the Greenbelt or effectively remove land from it; and

That notwithstanding the announced changes to Bill 66, the City of Burlington will not exercise any powers granted to it in this or any future sections or schedules to pass such planning by-laws where they are contrary to the Citys Official Plan; and
That the approval of a Bill 66 by-law clearly requires that the integrity of the Greenbelt and source water protection be achieved; and

121,Regular Meeting of Council,2/25/2019,Angelo Bentivegna,"Whereas, the Government of Ontario has announced a review of Ontario's eight regional municipalities (Durham, Halton, Muskoka District, Niagara, Oxford County, Peel, Waterloo, York), the County of Simcoe, and their lower-tier municipalities by appointed Special Advisors; and

Whereas, the provincially appointed Special Advisors are to provide advice and develop recommendations for the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing for the purpose of improving governance, decision-making and service delivery in the eight regions and Simcoe County and their lower-tier municipalities; and

Whereas, the Association of Municipalities of Ontario informed its members last August, that the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing began informal discussions on regional governance review, wishing to hear from municipalities about how this system of governance is working recognizing it was established in the 1970s; and

Whereas, the provincially appointed Special Advisors have included within the scope of their review, consideration of moving to single-tier municipalities or amalgamating existing municipalities; and

Whereas, neither Halton Region, nor the four area municipalities have requested a review of the current regional governance structure; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington, Halton Region and the other Halton area municipalities would receive greater benefit from a review of provincial permitting/approvals and municipal government powers and authority under the Municipal Act; and

Whereas, the regional government review including new single tier municipalities or amalgamations was not ever discussed during the recent provincial election by the Premier or our local Members of Provincial Parliament; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington is well managed and efficient with the smallest Council in Halton and for a city of its size, with only seven elected members; and

Whereas, 97 per cent of Burlington residents are satisfied with the quality of Regional services; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington has contributed to Halton Regions AAA credit rating; and

Whereas, Halton is a model of municipal efficiency through service agreements between the area municipalities and the Region, including for example the City of Burlingtons operation of Halton Court Services on behalf of the four area municipalities, the operation of the Fire Communications on behalf of Town of Oakville and the Town of Halton Hills, and the Halton Co-operative Purchasing groups; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington welcomes all opportunities to improve municipal service delivery and achieve greater efficiencies and cost savings for all Burlington and Halton taxpayers and rate payers, now

Therefore, be it resolved,

That the Council of the City of Burlington endorses the current effectiveness of our two-tier municipal government as it has evolved based on mutual agreement with the Region of Halton and our partner Halton lower-tier municipalities since its inception in 1974; and

That the residents of the City of Burlington value the distinct identity of their community and do not wish to have their democratic voice diluted, within a larger and less directly accountable municipal governance structure; and

That this resolution be forwarded to all Halton municipalities, the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing and made publicly available.",Yes,CARRIED

169,Regular Meeting of Council,1/28/2019,Angelo Bentivegna,"Whereas, the Government of Ontario has introduced Bill 66, an Act to restore Ontarios competitiveness by amending or repealing certain Acts; and
 
Whereas, Schedule 10 of the proposed legislation would have amended the Planning Act to allow municipalities to pass open-for-business planning by-laws; and
Whereas, the Bill would have allowed such by-laws to override important planning, water, agricultural and environmental protections contained in the Clean Water Act, 2006, the Greenbelt Act, 2005, the Places to Grow Act, 2005, and other provincial legislation; and
Whereas, no notice or public hearing would have been required prior to the passing of such a by-law nor were there to be any appeal rights thereafter; and
Whereas, the Greenbelt is an integral component of land use planning that complements the Growth Plan to encourage smart planning, the reduction of sprawl, protection of natural and hydrological features and agricultural lands; and
Whereas, Burlingtons land mass is 50% rural, and the Greenbelt protects 1.8 million acres of farmland, local food supplies, the headwaters of our rivers and important forests and wildlife habitat; and
Whereas, a permanent Greenbelt is an important part of the planning for sustainable communities; and
Whereas, Burlington presently has 509 acres (206 hectares) of vacant employment land supply within the urban boundary ready to be used for business, without the need to weaken the protections provided by the Greenbelt or effectively remove land from it; and
Whereas, protections like those included in the Clean Water Act are critical to the health of Burlington residents; and
Whereas, the government has said it will now remove Section 10 from Bill 66; and
Whereas, nevertheless, Burlington City Council wishes to declare our commitment to protecting the Greenbelt, opposing urban boundary expansion, and protecting access to clean water;
Therefore, be it resolved,
That Schedule 10 in Bill 66 does not represent how the City of Burlington and its residents want to do business; and
That the City of Burlington opposes provisions in Schedule 10 of Bill 66, that amend, repeal or override the Clean Water Act, 2006, the Greenbelt Act, 2005 and other important legislation in the public interest and applauds their removal from the Bill; and
That notwithstanding the announced changes to Bill 66, the City of Burlington will not exercise any powers granted to it in this or any future sections or schedules to pass such planning by-laws where they are contrary to the Citys Official Plan; and
That the approval of a Bill 66 by-law clearly requires that the integrity of the Greenbelt and source water protection be achieved; and
That this resolution be distributed to: the leaders of all parties represented in the Legislature; the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing; the Minister of the Environment, Conservation and Parks; all Greater Golden Horseshoe municipalities, Halton MPPs, Environmental Defense, the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, and the Friends of the Greenbelt Foundation.",Yes,CARRIED

Intensification and density targets applications will continue to be fully examined through the Regions municipal comprehensive review to ensure its implementation fully reflects local contexts and conditions; and
Notwithstanding that the growth forecasts and density targets are minimums and municipalities are encouraged to go beyond them, the forecasts and targets are relevant to planning and must guide planning decisions given their relationship to infrastructure planning and development charge calculations among other community planning considerations; and
Municipalities should be considered compliant with provincial legislation when meeting the forecasts and targets, and any decisions to go beyond minimums should be a municipal decision based on local circumstances; and
Once a municipality has met their forecasts and targets in a defined area, or across the municipality, or both, they can only be altered through a five year Official Plan Review; and

Whereas the project would support and guide municipalities in identifying, valuing and accounting for natural assets in their financial planning and asset management programs and developing leading-edge, sustainable, cost-effective and climate resilient infrastructure.  The program will assist participating organizations to better manage our infrastructure and natural assets in the face of climate change, development pressures, and increasing challenges associated with asset management. It also presents an opportunity to leverage financial contributions as the Friends of the Greenbelt Foundation is also contributing funds; and
Whereas MNAI recently partnered with the Friends of the Greenbelt Foundation and is soliciting expressions of interest for up to 7 smaller/rural local governments (as attached) to host a pilot project located in a watershed area within or originating within Ontarios Greenbelt. Through this project, MNAI offers guidance and support through scientific, financial and municipal services management expertise. Partners are expected to commit to the approach, provide in-kind multi-disciplinary staff support, provide data, designate a project/partner lead, commit a total of $105, 000 (split among the partners), and participate in evaluation interviews/follow up exercises for 3 years after the close of the project; and
Whereas Conservation Halton has reviewed the Expression Of Interest (EOI) and is interested in partnering on a pilot project for either the Grindstone Creek (preferred) or Bronte Creek, both of which originate in the Greenbelt and flow through rural portions of Burlington and Hamilton.  Grindstone Creek is preferred as this includes Hamilton, downstream lands in Burlington and the RBG; and
Whereas; Conservation Halton would be the lead and costs would be shared. Further information about the initiative is in the attached letter from Conservation Halton (Appendix A); and
Whereas total funding from City of Burlington up to the amount of $35,000 is to be provided from the Tax Rate Stabilization Reserve Fund; and
Whereas this initiative dovetails nicely with our ongoing work on climate change adaptation and mitigation and can be integrated into existing staff work programs. It is one of the initiatives mentioned in a handout we received at our Climate Change workshop from the speaker from the Intact Centre for Climate Adaptation (see document Combatting Canadas Rising Flood Costs via natural infrastructure), produced in partnership with the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation; and
Whereas there is some urgency to indicating our interest to participate, as there is no formal intake period, but the EOI period will close as soon as suitable candidates are found. A copy of the EOI is attached as Appendix B MNAI can be found at https://mnai.ca.; and
Whereas I believe this program represents an opportunity for the city to continue our efforts to be flood resilient and protect our natural assets and infrastructure.
Now therefore be it resolved:
That Council endorse an Expression of Interest to participate in the MNAI program, including related financial and staff commitment; and
That Council authorize the Executive, Director of Capital Works and related departments to work with Conservation Halton and other parties to complete the application; and

housing supply; and
Whereas development charges are the primary municipal revenue source for the financing of municipal infrastructure required to increase housing supply; and
Whereas development charges only account for approximately 5-7% of new single family home prices in the GTA, and that housing prices are driven by the market; and
Whereas a reduction in development changes will reduce a municipalitys ability to finance essential infrastructure needed for growth, reduce the supply of serviced land and will unfairly impact existing homeowners; and
Whereas current development charges legislation, through the Development Charges Act, 1997 S.O. 1997 c.27 as amended does not allow municipalities to recover the full
cost of growth which is not consistent with the principle that growth pays for growth; and
Whereas Halton has an estimated annual funding gap of $87.7 million (including Region, Local, and School Boards) as a result of the inability to collect the full cost recovery under the current legislation; and
Whereas the current development charges legislation provides the ability to collect development charges prior to building permit/subdivision (Section 27), which is critical in
Halton for the delivery of infrastructure to support additional new housing; and
Whereas any reduction to the flexibility to finance growth through development charges will have a direct impact on Haltons ability to increase housing supply;
Now therefore be it resolved:
That the Provincial Government be called upon to not reduce the use of development charges or make changes to section 27 of the DCA; and
That the Provincial Government be called upon to improve the DCA, to ensure that all growth related costs of municipal infrastructure and services are recovered through development charges ensuring growth pays for growth; and
That the Regional Chair write a letter to the Premier, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing expressing Regional Councils concerns regarding changes to section 27 of the Development Charges Act or a reduction in the use of development charges, and that Halton would welcome the opportunity to work with the Provincial Government to find creative solutions to increase the stock of affordable housing, while ensuring that growth pays for growth; and

Whereas, infrastructure failures linked to climate change could cost Canada $300 billion over the next decade unless we change the way we build; and

Whereas, local governments are at the frontline of taking actions to manage the worst impacts of climate change, creating low carbon communities and calling on senior levels of government for a more urgent response; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington has already experienced consequences attributed to climate change such as the ice storm of December 2013, the flood of 2014, winter storm volatility in 2019, and the effects of invasive species; and

Whereas, climate change is currently ranked as the number three risk on the City of Burlingtons Enterprise Risk Register; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington understands that climate action and the low carbon transition also represents an opportunity for economic stimulation and job development opportunities in a new low-carbon economy; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington recognizes many local community groups and organizations are already taking collective action on climate change; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington recognizes that climate change is a significant issue with a goal for city operations to be net carbon neutral by 2040 and working towards the community becoming net carbon neutral by working collectively with community stakeholders and senior levels of government, and that more action is necessary.

Whereas the project would support and guide municipalities in identifying, valuing and accounting for natural assets in their financial planning and asset management programs and developing leading-edge, sustainable, cost-effective and climate resilient infrastructure.  The program will assist participating organizations to better manage our infrastructure and natural assets in the face of climate change, development pressures, and increasing challenges associated with asset management. It also presents an opportunity to leverage financial contributions as the Friends of the Greenbelt Foundation is also contributing funds; and
Whereas MNAI recently partnered with the Friends of the Greenbelt Foundation and is soliciting expressions of interest for up to 7 smaller/rural local governments (as attached) to host a pilot project located in a watershed area within or originating within Ontarios Greenbelt. Through this project, MNAI offers guidance and support through scientific, financial and municipal services management expertise. Partners are expected to commit to the approach, provide in-kind multi-disciplinary staff support, provide data, designate a project/partner lead, commit a total of $105, 000 (split among the partners), and participate in evaluation interviews/follow up exercises for 3 years after the close of the project; and
Whereas Conservation Halton has reviewed the Expression Of Interest (EOI) and is interested in partnering on a pilot project for either the Grindstone Creek (preferred) or Bronte Creek, both of which originate in the Greenbelt and flow through rural portions of Burlington and Hamilton.  Grindstone Creek is preferred as this includes Hamilton, downstream lands in Burlington and the RBG; and
Whereas; Conservation Halton would be the lead and costs would be shared. Further information about the initiative is in the attached letter from Conservation Halton (Appendix A); and
Whereas total funding from City of Burlington up to the amount of $35,000 is to be provided from the Tax Rate Stabilization Reserve Fund; and
Whereas this initiative dovetails nicely with our ongoing work on climate change adaptation and mitigation and can be integrated into existing staff work programs. It is one of the initiatives mentioned in a handout we received at our Climate Change workshop from the speaker from the Intact Centre for Climate Adaptation (see document Combatting Canadas Rising Flood Costs via natural infrastructure), produced in partnership with the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation; and
Whereas there is some urgency to indicating our interest to participate, as there is no formal intake period, but the EOI period will close as soon as suitable candidates are found. A copy of the EOI is attached as Appendix B MNAI can be found at https://mnai.ca.; and
Whereas I believe this program represents an opportunity for the city to continue our efforts to be flood resilient and protect our natural assets and infrastructure.
Now therefore be it resolved:
That Council endorse an Expression of Interest to participate in the MNAI program, including related financial and staff commitment; and
That Council authorize the Executive, Director of Capital Works and related departments to work with Conservation Halton and other parties to complete the application; and

housing supply; and
Whereas development charges are the primary municipal revenue source for the financing of municipal infrastructure required to increase housing supply; and
Whereas development charges only account for approximately 5-7% of new single family home prices in the GTA, and that housing prices are driven by the market; and
Whereas a reduction in development changes will reduce a municipalitys ability to finance essential infrastructure needed for growth, reduce the supply of serviced land and will unfairly impact existing homeowners; and
Whereas current development charges legislation, through the Development Charges Act, 1997 S.O. 1997 c.27 as amended does not allow municipalities to recover the full
cost of growth which is not consistent with the principle that growth pays for growth; and
Whereas Halton has an estimated annual funding gap of $87.7 million (including Region, Local, and School Boards) as a result of the inability to collect the full cost recovery under the current legislation; and
Whereas the current development charges legislation provides the ability to collect development charges prior to building permit/subdivision (Section 27), which is critical in
Halton for the delivery of infrastructure to support additional new housing; and
Whereas any reduction to the flexibility to finance growth through development charges will have a direct impact on Haltons ability to increase housing supply;
Now therefore be it resolved:
That the Provincial Government be called upon to not reduce the use of development charges or make changes to section 27 of the DCA; and
That the Provincial Government be called upon to improve the DCA, to ensure that all growth related costs of municipal infrastructure and services are recovered through development charges ensuring growth pays for growth; and

Whereas, infrastructure failures linked to climate change could cost Canada $300 billion over the next decade unless we change the way we build; and

Whereas, local governments are at the frontline of taking actions to manage the worst impacts of climate change, creating low carbon communities and calling on senior levels of government for a more urgent response; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington has already experienced consequences attributed to climate change such as the ice storm of December 2013, the flood of 2014, winter storm volatility in 2019, and the effects of invasive species; and

Whereas, climate change is currently ranked as the number three risk on the City of Burlingtons Enterprise Risk Register; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington understands that climate action and the low carbon transition also represents an opportunity for economic stimulation and job development opportunities in a new low-carbon economy; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington recognizes many local community groups and organizations are already taking collective action on climate change; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington recognizes that climate change is a significant issue with a goal for city operations to be net carbon neutral by 2040 and working towards the community becoming net carbon neutral by working collectively with community stakeholders and senior levels of government, and that more action is necessary.

Whereas the project would support and guide municipalities in identifying, valuing and accounting for natural assets in their financial planning and asset management programs and developing leading-edge, sustainable, cost-effective and climate resilient infrastructure.  The program will assist participating organizations to better manage our infrastructure and natural assets in the face of climate change, development pressures, and increasing challenges associated with asset management. It also presents an opportunity to leverage financial contributions as the Friends of the Greenbelt Foundation is also contributing funds; and
Whereas MNAI recently partnered with the Friends of the Greenbelt Foundation and is soliciting expressions of interest for up to 7 smaller/rural local governments (as attached) to host a pilot project located in a watershed area within or originating within Ontarios Greenbelt. Through this project, MNAI offers guidance and support through scientific, financial and municipal services management expertise. Partners are expected to commit to the approach, provide in-kind multi-disciplinary staff support, provide data, designate a project/partner lead, commit a total of $105, 000 (split among the partners), and participate in evaluation interviews/follow up exercises for 3 years after the close of the project; and
Whereas Conservation Halton has reviewed the Expression Of Interest (EOI) and is interested in partnering on a pilot project for either the Grindstone Creek (preferred) or Bronte Creek, both of which originate in the Greenbelt and flow through rural portions of Burlington and Hamilton.  Grindstone Creek is preferred as this includes Hamilton, downstream lands in Burlington and the RBG; and
Whereas; Conservation Halton would be the lead and costs would be shared. Further information about the initiative is in the attached letter from Conservation Halton (Appendix A); and
Whereas total funding from City of Burlington up to the amount of $35,000 is to be provided from the Tax Rate Stabilization Reserve Fund; and
Whereas this initiative dovetails nicely with our ongoing work on climate change adaptation and mitigation and can be integrated into existing staff work programs. It is one of the initiatives mentioned in a handout we received at our Climate Change workshop from the speaker from the Intact Centre for Climate Adaptation (see document Combatting Canadas Rising Flood Costs via natural infrastructure), produced in partnership with the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation; and
Whereas there is some urgency to indicating our interest to participate, as there is no formal intake period, but the EOI period will close as soon as suitable candidates are found. A copy of the EOI is attached as Appendix B MNAI can be found at https://mnai.ca.; and
Whereas I believe this program represents an opportunity for the city to continue our efforts to be flood resilient and protect our natural assets and infrastructure.
Now therefore be it resolved:
That Council endorse an Expression of Interest to participate in the MNAI program, including related financial and staff commitment; and
That Council authorize the Executive, Director of Capital Works and related departments to work with Conservation Halton and other parties to complete the application; and

housing supply; and
Whereas development charges are the primary municipal revenue source for the financing of municipal infrastructure required to increase housing supply; and
Whereas development charges only account for approximately 5-7% of new single family home prices in the GTA, and that housing prices are driven by the market; and
Whereas a reduction in development changes will reduce a municipalitys ability to finance essential infrastructure needed for growth, reduce the supply of serviced land and will unfairly impact existing homeowners; and
Whereas current development charges legislation, through the Development Charges Act, 1997 S.O. 1997 c.27 as amended does not allow municipalities to recover the full
cost of growth which is not consistent with the principle that growth pays for growth; and
Whereas Halton has an estimated annual funding gap of $87.7 million (including Region, Local, and School Boards) as a result of the inability to collect the full cost recovery under the current legislation; and
Whereas the current development charges legislation provides the ability to collect development charges prior to building permit/subdivision (Section 27), which is critical in
Halton for the delivery of infrastructure to support additional new housing; and
Whereas any reduction to the flexibility to finance growth through development charges will have a direct impact on Haltons ability to increase housing supply;
Now therefore be it resolved:
That the Provincial Government be called upon to not reduce the use of development charges or make changes to section 27 of the DCA; and
That the Provincial Government be called upon to improve the DCA, to ensure that all growth related costs of municipal infrastructure and services are recovered through development charges ensuring growth pays for growth; and
That the Regional Chair write a letter to the Premier, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing expressing Regional Councils concerns regarding changes to section 27 of the Development Charges Act or a reduction in the use of development charges, and that Halton would welcome the opportunity to work with the Provincial Government to find creative solutions to increase the stock of affordable housing, while ensuring that growth pays for growth; and

Whereas, Canada is, according to the Government of Canadas April 2019 Changing Climate Report, experiencing warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world, with Northern Canada heating up at almost three times the global average; and

Whereas, infrastructure failures linked to climate change could cost Canada $300 billion over the next decade unless we change the way we build; and

Whereas, local governments are at the frontline of taking actions to manage the worst impacts of climate change, creating low carbon communities and calling on senior levels of government for a more urgent response; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington has already experienced consequences attributed to climate change such as the ice storm of December 2013, the flood of 2014, winter storm volatility in 2019, and the effects of invasive species; and

Whereas, climate change is currently ranked as the number three risk on the City of Burlingtons Enterprise Risk Register; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington understands that climate action and the low carbon transition also represents an opportunity for economic stimulation and job development opportunities in a new low-carbon economy; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington recognizes many local community groups and organizations are already taking collective action on climate change; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington recognizes that climate change is a significant issue with a goal for city operations to be net carbon neutral by 2040 and working towards the community becoming net carbon neutral by working collectively with community stakeholders and senior levels of government, and that more action is necessary.

Now therefore be it resolved:

That the City of Burlington declare a climate emergency for the purposes of deepening our commitment to protecting our economy, environment and community from climate change; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington understands that climate action and the low carbon transition also represents an opportunity for economic stimulation and job development opportunities in a new low-carbon economy; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington recognizes many local community groups and organizations are already taking collective action on climate change; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington recognizes that climate change is a significant issue with a goal for city operations to be net carbon neutral by 2040 and working towards the community becoming net carbon neutral by working collectively with community stakeholders and senior levels of government, and that more action is necessary.

Now therefore be it resolved:

That the City of Burlington declare a climate emergency for the purposes of deepening our commitment to protecting our economy, environment and community from climate change; and

That Council and staff immediately increase the priority of the fight against climate change and apply a climate lens to the plans and actions of the City of Burlington including the Council strategic workplan and future budgets; and

That staff are directed to bring a report to the June 3, 2019 Committee of the Whole meeting that outlines actions taken to date and includes a critical path for the development of the first City of Burlington Climate Action Plan that will:

a. address the operations of the corporation of the municipality as well as the functioning of the entire community; and

b. include a plan for a thorough and complete consultation with stakeholders and the community; and

c. increase action and ambition for the Citys climate change-related activities; and
d. include performance metrics to track progress and timelines for achieving key deliverables/major milestones, and a strategy to report back publicly on progress.

Direct the City Manager to bring the Burlington Climate Action Plan to Council no later than December 2019 for approval.",Yes,CARRIED

Whereas the project would support and guide municipalities in identifying, valuing and accounting for natural assets in their financial planning and asset management programs and developing leading-edge, sustainable, cost-effective and climate resilient infrastructure.  The program will assist participating organizations to better manage our infrastructure and natural assets in the face of climate change, development pressures, and increasing challenges associated with asset management. It also presents an opportunity to leverage financial contributions as the Friends of the Greenbelt Foundation is also contributing funds; and
Whereas MNAI recently partnered with the Friends of the Greenbelt Foundation and is soliciting expressions of interest for up to 7 smaller/rural local governments (as attached) to host a pilot project located in a watershed area within or originating within Ontarios Greenbelt. Through this project, MNAI offers guidance and support through scientific, financial and municipal services management expertise. Partners are expected to commit to the approach, provide in-kind multi-disciplinary staff support, provide data, designate a project/partner lead, commit a total of $105, 000 (split among the partners), and participate in evaluation interviews/follow up exercises for 3 years after the close of the project; and
Whereas Conservation Halton has reviewed the Expression Of Interest (EOI) and is interested in partnering on a pilot project for either the Grindstone Creek (preferred) or Bronte Creek, both of which originate in the Greenbelt and flow through rural portions of Burlington and Hamilton.  Grindstone Creek is preferred as this includes Hamilton, downstream lands in Burlington and the RBG; and
Whereas; Conservation Halton would be the lead and costs would be shared. Further information about the initiative is in the attached letter from Conservation Halton (Appendix A); and
Whereas total funding from City of Burlington up to the amount of $35,000 is to be provided from the Tax Rate Stabilization Reserve Fund; and
Whereas this initiative dovetails nicely with our ongoing work on climate change adaptation and mitigation and can be integrated into existing staff work programs. It is one of the initiatives mentioned in a handout we received at our Climate Change workshop from the speaker from the Intact Centre for Climate Adaptation (see document Combatting Canadas Rising Flood Costs via natural infrastructure), produced in partnership with the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation; and
Whereas there is some urgency to indicating our interest to participate, as there is no formal intake period, but the EOI period will close as soon as suitable candidates are found. A copy of the EOI is attached as Appendix B MNAI can be found at https://mnai.ca.; and
Whereas I believe this program represents an opportunity for the city to continue our efforts to be flood resilient and protect our natural assets and infrastructure.
Now therefore be it resolved:
That Council endorse an Expression of Interest to participate in the MNAI program, including related financial and staff commitment; and
That Council authorize the Executive, Director of Capital Works and related departments to work with Conservation Halton and other parties to complete the application; and
That upon passage of this resolution, city staff continue discussions with counterpart staff at the City of Hamilton and Royal Botanical Garden to seek their participation in the program.",Yes,CARRIED

housing supply; and
Whereas development charges are the primary municipal revenue source for the financing of municipal infrastructure required to increase housing supply; and
Whereas development charges only account for approximately 5-7% of new single family home prices in the GTA, and that housing prices are driven by the market; and
Whereas a reduction in development changes will reduce a municipalitys ability to finance essential infrastructure needed for growth, reduce the supply of serviced land and will unfairly impact existing homeowners; and
Whereas current development charges legislation, through the Development Charges Act, 1997 S.O. 1997 c.27 as amended does not allow municipalities to recover the full
cost of growth which is not consistent with the principle that growth pays for growth; and
Whereas Halton has an estimated annual funding gap of $87.7 million (including Region, Local, and School Boards) as a result of the inability to collect the full cost recovery under the current legislation; and
Whereas the current development charges legislation provides the ability to collect development charges prior to building permit/subdivision (Section 27), which is critical in
Halton for the delivery of infrastructure to support additional new housing; and
Whereas any reduction to the flexibility to finance growth through development charges will have a direct impact on Haltons ability to increase housing supply;
Now therefore be it resolved:
That the Provincial Government be called upon to not reduce the use of development charges or make changes to section 27 of the DCA; and
That the Provincial Government be called upon to improve the DCA, to ensure that all growth related costs of municipal infrastructure and services are recovered through development charges ensuring growth pays for growth; and
That the Regional Chair write a letter to the Premier, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing expressing Regional Councils concerns regarding changes to section 27 of the Development Charges Act or a reduction in the use of development charges, and that Halton would welcome the opportunity to work with the Provincial Government to find creative solutions to increase the stock of affordable housing, while ensuring that growth pays for growth; and

Whereas, Canada is, according to the Government of Canadas April 2019 Changing Climate Report, experiencing warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world, with Northern Canada heating up at almost three times the global average; and

Whereas, infrastructure failures linked to climate change could cost Canada $300 billion over the next decade unless we change the way we build; and

Whereas, local governments are at the frontline of taking actions to manage the worst impacts of climate change, creating low carbon communities and calling on senior levels of government for a more urgent response; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington has already experienced consequences attributed to climate change such as the ice storm of December 2013, the flood of 2014, winter storm volatility in 2019, and the effects of invasive species; and

Whereas, climate change is currently ranked as the number three risk on the City of Burlingtons Enterprise Risk Register; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington understands that climate action and the low carbon transition also represents an opportunity for economic stimulation and job development opportunities in a new low-carbon economy; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington recognizes many local community groups and organizations are already taking collective action on climate change; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington recognizes that climate change is a significant issue with a goal for city operations to be net carbon neutral by 2040 and working towards the community becoming net carbon neutral by working collectively with community stakeholders and senior levels of government, and that more action is necessary.

Whereas the project would support and guide municipalities in identifying, valuing and accounting for natural assets in their financial planning and asset management programs and developing leading-edge, sustainable, cost-effective and climate resilient infrastructure.  The program will assist participating organizations to better manage our infrastructure and natural assets in the face of climate change, development pressures, and increasing challenges associated with asset management. It also presents an opportunity to leverage financial contributions as the Friends of the Greenbelt Foundation is also contributing funds; and
Whereas MNAI recently partnered with the Friends of the Greenbelt Foundation and is soliciting expressions of interest for up to 7 smaller/rural local governments (as attached) to host a pilot project located in a watershed area within or originating within Ontarios Greenbelt. Through this project, MNAI offers guidance and support through scientific, financial and municipal services management expertise. Partners are expected to commit to the approach, provide in-kind multi-disciplinary staff support, provide data, designate a project/partner lead, commit a total of $105, 000 (split among the partners), and participate in evaluation interviews/follow up exercises for 3 years after the close of the project; and
Whereas Conservation Halton has reviewed the Expression Of Interest (EOI) and is interested in partnering on a pilot project for either the Grindstone Creek (preferred) or Bronte Creek, both of which originate in the Greenbelt and flow through rural portions of Burlington and Hamilton.  Grindstone Creek is preferred as this includes Hamilton, downstream lands in Burlington and the RBG; and
Whereas; Conservation Halton would be the lead and costs would be shared. Further information about the initiative is in the attached letter from Conservation Halton (Appendix A); and
Whereas total funding from City of Burlington up to the amount of $35,000 is to be provided from the Tax Rate Stabilization Reserve Fund; and
Whereas this initiative dovetails nicely with our ongoing work on climate change adaptation and mitigation and can be integrated into existing staff work programs. It is one of the initiatives mentioned in a handout we received at our Climate Change workshop from the speaker from the Intact Centre for Climate Adaptation (see document Combatting Canadas Rising Flood Costs via natural infrastructure), produced in partnership with the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation; and
Whereas there is some urgency to indicating our interest to participate, as there is no formal intake period, but the EOI period will close as soon as suitable candidates are found. A copy of the EOI is attached as Appendix B MNAI can be found at https://mnai.ca.; and
Whereas I believe this program represents an opportunity for the city to continue our efforts to be flood resilient and protect our natural assets and infrastructure.
Now therefore be it resolved:
That Council endorse an Expression of Interest to participate in the MNAI program, including related financial and staff commitment; and
That Council authorize the Executive, Director of Capital Works and related departments to work with Conservation Halton and other parties to complete the application; and

housing supply; and
Whereas development charges are the primary municipal revenue source for the financing of municipal infrastructure required to increase housing supply; and
Whereas development charges only account for approximately 5-7% of new single family home prices in the GTA, and that housing prices are driven by the market; and
Whereas a reduction in development changes will reduce a municipalitys ability to finance essential infrastructure needed for growth, reduce the supply of serviced land and will unfairly impact existing homeowners; and
Whereas current development charges legislation, through the Development Charges Act, 1997 S.O. 1997 c.27 as amended does not allow municipalities to recover the full
cost of growth which is not consistent with the principle that growth pays for growth; and
Whereas Halton has an estimated annual funding gap of $87.7 million (including Region, Local, and School Boards) as a result of the inability to collect the full cost recovery under the current legislation; and
Whereas the current development charges legislation provides the ability to collect development charges prior to building permit/subdivision (Section 27), which is critical in
Halton for the delivery of infrastructure to support additional new housing; and
Whereas any reduction to the flexibility to finance growth through development charges will have a direct impact on Haltons ability to increase housing supply;
Now therefore be it resolved:
That the Provincial Government be called upon to not reduce the use of development charges or make changes to section 27 of the DCA; and
That the Provincial Government be called upon to improve the DCA, to ensure that all growth related costs of municipal infrastructure and services are recovered through development charges ensuring growth pays for growth; and
That the Regional Chair write a letter to the Premier, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing expressing Regional Councils concerns regarding changes to section 27 of the Development Charges Act or a reduction in the use of development charges, and that Halton would welcome the opportunity to work with the Provincial Government to find creative solutions to increase the stock of affordable housing, while ensuring that growth pays for growth; and

Whereas, infrastructure failures linked to climate change could cost Canada $300 billion over the next decade unless we change the way we build; and

Whereas, local governments are at the frontline of taking actions to manage the worst impacts of climate change, creating low carbon communities and calling on senior levels of government for a more urgent response; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington has already experienced consequences attributed to climate change such as the ice storm of December 2013, the flood of 2014, winter storm volatility in 2019, and the effects of invasive species; and

Whereas, climate change is currently ranked as the number three risk on the City of Burlingtons Enterprise Risk Register; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington understands that climate action and the low carbon transition also represents an opportunity for economic stimulation and job development opportunities in a new low-carbon economy; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington recognizes many local community groups and organizations are already taking collective action on climate change; and

Whereas, the City of Burlington recognizes that climate change is a significant issue with a goal for city operations to be net carbon neutral by 2040 and working towards the community becoming net carbon neutral by working collectively with community stakeholders and senior levels of government, and that more action is necessary.

CN has not disclosed its plans for the remaining lands on this site; and
Whereas The hub will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week and result in 1,600 truck trips to and from the site each day. This congestion poses a risk to the safety of motorists, cyclists, pedestrians and families in the area; and
Whereas the proposed site is immediately adjacent to existing and future residential areas. Approximately 34,000 current and future residents, twelve schools, two long-term care homes and one hospital are located within one kilometer of the site. The site will generate increased levels of noise, air pollution and lighting, and significantly impact the communitys health and safety; and
Whereas efforts to protect the environment will be impacted by the effect of emissions, storm water discharge, water takings and watercourse alterations; and
Whereas the project will result in less serviceable employment lands and potentially fewer jobs for Halton. The site and the surrounding area currently plan for 1,500 jobs and this project will only result in 130 jobs; and
Whereas the project is currently being assessed by a Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency Joint Review Panel Process; and
Whereas the Halton Municipalities have identified significant non-rail aspects of the project that raise concerns for residents and the community and have brought forward these concerns to the Panel.

886,Regular Meeting of Council,9/23/2019,Kelvin Galbraith,"Whereas, Mental Health awareness and education are necessary in high schools to support the well- being of all students; and
Whereas, Mrs. Natalie Pierre delegated to the Halton District School Board on Tuesday, September 3, on the subject of student mental health; and
Whereas, The Halton Catholic District School Board have moved and carried the following motion.
Be it resolved that the Halton Catholic District School Board accept the delegation regarding Student Mental Health and have a staff report forthcoming in conjunction with our mental health advisory and steering committee and that report addresses the concerns and suggestions identified in the delegation for the Boards 2019-2020 Mental Health and Well Being Strategy; and
In addition to providing education in physical health, schools are uniquely positioned to provide students with mental health education, giving students the tools they need to navigate mental health problems they might encounter, and learning to recognize when a friend or loved one might be struggling. Addressing and supporting mental health early on in life is important. 50 percent of individuals with a diagnosable mental health disorder will receive a diagnosis by age 14, 75 percent by the age of 24, and most will begin experiencing symptoms years before that. Given these facts, programs that better connect health and education systems should be prioritized. Students need to understand signs and symptoms of mental distress and their treatments, how to look after their own mental health and where to get help.
School-based mental health education can provide support and resources for young people, who otherwise may feel isolated. Teaching mental health education as part of the school curriculum is long overdue. If everyone in our schools is empowered with knowledge, and dialogue is encouraged, students will have the freedom to open up about what they are going through and know where and how to get the support they need. Open and honest discussion about mental health reduces stigma; and
Whereas, Burlington residents are working with their local MPP to present a petition in the Ontario Legislative Assembly to ask the Provincial Government to support mental health instruction in all Ontario secondary schools; and
Whereas, several members of Council have written to the Halton Catholic District School Board in support of the residents request to add mental health instruction in secondary schools; and
Therefore, be it resolved that: Burlington City Council endorse the request to the Province of Ontario to include and expand mental health education and programming to the Ontario secondary school curriculum; and

928,Regular Meeting of Council,7/15/2019,Angelo Bentivegna,"Whereas CN is proposing a logistics truck and rail hub, consisting of approximately 160 ha (400 acres) of the 486 ha (1200 acres) of land it owns around its existing mainline rail, east of Tremaine Road and south of Britannia Road, in the Town of Milton. CN has not disclosed its plans for the remaining lands on this site; and
Whereas The hub will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week and result in 1,600 truck trips to and from the site each day. This congestion poses a risk to the safety of motorists, cyclists, pedestrians and families in the area; and
Whereas the proposed site is immediately adjacent to existing and future residential areas. Approximately 34,000 current and future residents, twelve schools, two long-term care homes and one hospital are located within one kilometer of the site. The site will generate increased levels of noise, air pollution and lighting, and significantly impact the communitys health and safety; and
Whereas efforts to protect the environment will be impacted by the effect of emissions, storm water discharge, water takings and watercourse alterations; and
Whereas the project will result in less serviceable employment lands and potentially fewer jobs for Halton. The site and the surrounding area currently plan for 1,500 jobs and this project will only result in 130 jobs; and
Whereas the project is currently being assessed by a Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency Joint Review Panel Process; and
Whereas the Halton Municipalities have identified significant non-rail aspects of the project that raise concerns for residents and the community and have brought forward these concerns to the Panel.
Now therefore be it resolved that the City of Burlington supports the May 29, 2019 submissions of the Halton Municipalities to the review panel established under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (CEAA) including, in particular, the findings that the Proposed CN Milton Logistics Hub Project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects, as further outlined in Report No. LPS78-19 re: CEAA Panel Review of the Proposed CN Milton Logistics Hub, attached as Appendix A  Halton Region Report No. LPS78-19; and

That the City Clerk forward a copy this resolution to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Review Panel for the Proposed CN Milton Logistics Hub; and
That the City Clerk forward a copy of this resolution to the Town of Halton Hills, the Town of Milton, the Town of Oakville and Conservation Halton, Haltons MPs and MPPs, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, the City of Mississauga, the Regional Municipality of Peel and the Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing.",Yes,CARRIED

1000,Regular Meeting of Council,9/23/2019,Shawna Stolte,"Whereas, Mental Health awareness and education are necessary in high schools to support the well- being of all students; and
Whereas, Mrs. Natalie Pierre delegated to the Halton District School Board on Tuesday, September 3, on the subject of student mental health; and
Whereas, The Halton Catholic District School Board have moved and carried the following motion.
Be it resolved that the Halton Catholic District School Board accept the delegation regarding Student Mental Health and have a staff report forthcoming in conjunction with our mental health advisory and steering committee and that report addresses the concerns and suggestions identified in the delegation for the Boards 2019-2020 Mental Health and Well Being Strategy; and
In addition to providing education in physical health, schools are uniquely positioned to provide students with mental health education, giving students the tools they need to navigate mental health problems they might encounter, and learning to recognize when a friend or loved one might be struggling. Addressing and supporting mental health early on in life is important. 50 percent of individuals with a diagnosable mental health disorder will receive a diagnosis by age 14, 75 percent by the age of 24, and most will begin experiencing symptoms years before that. Given these facts, programs that better connect health and education systems should be prioritized. Students need to understand signs and symptoms of mental distress and their treatments, how to look after their own mental health and where to get help.
School-based mental health education can provide support and resources for young people, who otherwise may feel isolated. Teaching mental health education as part of the school curriculum is long overdue. If everyone in our schools is empowered with knowledge, and dialogue is encouraged, students will have the freedom to open up about what they are going through and know where and how to get the support they need. Open and honest discussion about mental health reduces stigma; and
Whereas, Burlington residents are working with their local MPP to present a petition in the Ontario Legislative Assembly to ask the Provincial Government to support mental health instruction in all Ontario secondary schools; and
Whereas, several members of Council have written to the Halton Catholic District School Board in support of the residents request to add mental health instruction in secondary schools; and
Therefore, be it resolved that: Burlington City Council endorse the request to the Province of Ontario to include and expand mental health education and programming to the Ontario secondary school curriculum; and
That a copy of this resolution be forwarded to Halton Region municipalities, the Premier and Burlington MPP's and MP's",Yes,CARRIED

Whereas, Mrs. Natalie Pierre delegated to the Halton District School Board on Tuesday, September 3, on the subject of student mental health; and
Whereas, The Halton Catholic District School Board have moved and carried the following motion.
Be it resolved that the Halton Catholic District School Board accept the delegation regarding Student Mental Health and have a staff report forthcoming in conjunction with our mental health advisory and steering committee and that report addresses the concerns and suggestions identified in the delegation for the Boards 2019-2020 Mental Health and Well Being Strategy; and
In addition to providing education in physical health, schools are uniquely positioned to provide students with mental health education, giving students the tools they need to navigate mental health problems they might encounter, and learning to recognize when a friend or loved one might be struggling. Addressing and supporting mental health early on in life is important. 50 percent of individuals with a diagnosable mental health disorder will receive a diagnosis by age 14, 75 percent by the age of 24, and most will begin experiencing symptoms years before that. Given these facts, programs that better connect health and education systems should be prioritized. Students need to understand signs and symptoms of mental distress and their treatments, how to look after their own mental health and where to get help.
School-based mental health education can provide support and resources for young people, who otherwise may feel isolated. Teaching mental health education as part of the school curriculum is long overdue. If everyone in our schools is empowered with knowledge, and dialogue is encouraged, students will have the freedom to open up about what they are going through and know where and how to get the support they need. Open and honest discussion about mental health reduces stigma; and

CN has not disclosed its plans for the remaining lands on this site; and
Whereas The hub will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week and result in 1,600 truck trips to and from the site each day. This congestion poses a risk to the safety of motorists, cyclists, pedestrians and families in the area; and
Whereas the proposed site is immediately adjacent to existing and future residential areas. Approximately 34,000 current and future residents, twelve schools, two long-term care homes and one hospital are located within one kilometer of the site. The site will generate increased levels of noise, air pollution and lighting, and significantly impact the communitys health and safety; and
Whereas efforts to protect the environment will be impacted by the effect of emissions, storm water discharge, water takings and watercourse alterations; and
Whereas the project will result in less serviceable employment lands and potentially fewer jobs for Halton. The site and the surrounding area currently plan for 1,500 jobs and this project will only result in 130 jobs; and
Whereas the project is currently being assessed by a Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency Joint Review Panel Process; and
Whereas the Halton Municipalities have identified significant non-rail aspects of the project that raise concerns for residents and the community and have brought forward these concerns to the Panel.
Now therefore be it resolved that the City of Burlington supports the May 29, 2019 submissions of the Halton Municipalities to the review panel established under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (CEAA) including, in particular, the findings that the Proposed CN Milton Logistics Hub Project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects, as further outlined in Report No. LPS78-19 re: CEAA Panel Review of the Proposed CN Milton Logistics Hub, attached as Appendix A  Halton Region Report No. LPS78-19; and
That the City supports the May 29, 2019 submissions for setting out the interests of the localities relevant to CEAA and section 98 of the Canada Transportation Act (CTA), as further outlined in Report No. LPS78-19 re: CEAA Panel Review of the Proposed CN Milton Logistics Hub; and

1192,Regular Meeting of Council,7/15/2019,Paul Sharman,"Whereas CN is proposing a logistics truck and rail hub, consisting of approximately 160 ha (400 acres) of the 486 ha (1200 acres) of land it owns around its existing mainline rail, east of Tremaine Road and south of Britannia Road, in the Town of Milton. CN has not disclosed its plans for the remaining lands on this site; and
Whereas The hub will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week and result in 1,600 truck trips to and from the site each day. This congestion poses a risk to the safety of motorists, cyclists, pedestrians and families in the area; and
Whereas the proposed site is immediately adjacent to existing and future residential areas. Approximately 34,000 current and future residents, twelve schools, two long-term care homes and one hospital are located within one kilometer of the site. The site will generate increased levels of noise, air pollution and lighting, and significantly impact the communitys health and safety; and
Whereas efforts to protect the environment will be impacted by the effect of emissions, storm water discharge, water takings and watercourse alterations; and
Whereas the project will result in less serviceable employment lands and potentially fewer jobs for Halton. The site and the surrounding area currently plan for 1,500 jobs and this project will only result in 130 jobs; and
Whereas the project is currently being assessed by a Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency Joint Review Panel Process; and
Whereas the Halton Municipalities have identified significant non-rail aspects of the project that raise concerns for residents and the community and have brought forward these concerns to the Panel.
Now therefore be it resolved that the City of Burlington supports the May 29, 2019 submissions of the Halton Municipalities to the review panel established under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (CEAA) including, in particular, the findings that the Proposed CN Milton Logistics Hub Project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects, as further outlined in Report No. LPS78-19 re: CEAA Panel Review of the Proposed CN Milton Logistics Hub, attached as Appendix A  Halton Region Report No. LPS78-19; and

Libraries and the early literacy programs that they run are integral to developing proficient readers and ensuring that children succeed in school. More and more, digital literacy programs run by libraries also help ensure that citizens can contribute to our digital world. Additionally, vulnerable demographic groups, including seniors, low income families, youth, and new Canadians rely on access to libraries as an important tool for their participation in the community  from education to searching for jobs to consuming Canadian cultural materials; and
Whereas libraries in our community recognize that our users increasingly seek to access digital publications offered by multinational publishers, and that access to those publications is too often curtailed by prohibitively high licensing fees or else entirely denied to Canadian libraries; and
Whereas libraries must be in a position to offer digital publications to their users as part of their service offering to our community, particularly given the contemporary rapid pace of digitization of educational and cultural materials; and
Now therefore be it resolved that the City of Burlington do hereby:
Indicate our support for the Canadian Urban Libraries Council in its efforts to increase access to digital publications for library users in Burlington and across Canada; and
Call on the Federal government to investigate the barriers faced by libraries in acquiring digital publications and the problems that poses for vulnerable demographic groups in Canada; and

Whereas libraries in our community recognize that our users increasingly seek to access digital publications offered by multinational publishers, and that access to those publications is too often curtailed by prohibitively high licensing fees or else entirely denied to Canadian libraries; and
Whereas libraries must be in a position to offer digital publications to their users as part of their service offering to our community, particularly given the contemporary rapid pace of digitization of educational and cultural materials; and

1576,Regular Meeting of Council,9/23/2019,Angelo Bentivegna,"Whereas, Mental Health awareness and education are necessary in high schools to support the well- being of all students; and
Whereas, Mrs. Natalie Pierre delegated to the Halton District School Board on Tuesday, September 3, on the subject of student mental health; and
Whereas, The Halton Catholic District School Board have moved and carried the following motion.
Be it resolved that the Halton Catholic District School Board accept the delegation regarding Student Mental Health and have a staff report forthcoming in conjunction with our mental health advisory and steering committee and that report addresses the concerns and suggestions identified in the delegation for the Boards 2019-2020 Mental Health and Well Being Strategy; and
In addition to providing education in physical health, schools are uniquely positioned to provide students with mental health education, giving students the tools they need to navigate mental health problems they might encounter, and learning to recognize when a friend or loved one might be struggling. Addressing and supporting mental health early on in life is important. 50 percent of individuals with a diagnosable mental health disorder will receive a diagnosis by age 14, 75 percent by the age of 24, and most will begin experiencing symptoms years before that. Given these facts, programs that better connect health and education systems should be prioritized. Students need to understand signs and symptoms of mental distress and their treatments, how to look after their own mental health and where to get help.
School-based mental health education can provide support and resources for young people, who otherwise may feel isolated. Teaching mental health education as part of the school curriculum is long overdue. If everyone in our schools is empowered with knowledge, and dialogue is encouraged, students will have the freedom to open up about what they are going through and know where and how to get the support they need. Open and honest discussion about mental health reduces stigma; and
Whereas, Burlington residents are working with their local MPP to present a petition in the Ontario Legislative Assembly to ask the Provincial Government to support mental health instruction in all Ontario secondary schools; and
Whereas, several members of Council have written to the Halton Catholic District School Board in support of the residents request to add mental health instruction in secondary schools; and
